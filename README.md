# The_Counting_of_the_Sheep
A very vital task for a herder, is to count sheep. Hence with two ultrasonic sensors connected to the Arduino, the farmer can keep track of his sheep as they enter and exit the field.

When motion is detected in the first sensor, assuming the average time for the sheep to enter is 700 milliseconds, it adds a sheep to the count. If the second sensor is triggered, it subtracts a sheep from the count.
